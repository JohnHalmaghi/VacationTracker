# VacationTracker
A Java desktop app which uses the MVC design pattern and Swing to get flight information from a user via a GUI. I then (will) use the [SkyScanner API](https://partners.skyscanner.net/affiliates/travel-apis) to keep track of flights entered and look for price drops to alert the user. I decided to make this because I like saving money and I wanted to learn the basics of Java GUI design and how to add persistence to my apps (I achieve this by Searializing the ArrayList which contains all the flights being tracked in the data.bin file, then deserializing it on startup.) I'm still waiting to get a free API key.
